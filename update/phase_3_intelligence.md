# Phase 3: Scale, Intelligence & Automation

In this final phase, the system matures from a management tool to a strategic asset, leveraging data and integrations to scale operations effortlessly.

## 1. Multi-Location Consolidation (Global View)
*   **Problem**: Admins currently have to switch between locations to see stock/revenue.
*   **Solution**: "Headquarters" dashboard mode.
*   **Scope**:
    *   **Consolidated Financials**: View total revenue across all 5-50 locations in one chart.
    *   **Inter-Store Stock Search**: Instantly find which location has a specific item in stock during a customer inquiry.
    *   **Global Alerts**: High-level stock exceptions across the entire organization.

## 2. External API & Webhooks (Ecosystem)
*   **Problem**: Data is trapped inside the inventory system.
*   **Solution**: Public API and real-time triggers.
*   **Scope**:
    *   **Developer API**: Allow 3rd party developers to build custom extensions.
    *   **Accounting Integrations**: Direct push of sales/expenses to QuickBooks or Xero.
    *   **Webhook Triggers**: Notify external systems immediately when a low stock alert or a large sale occurs.

## 3. Decision Intelligence (Predictive)
*   **Problem**: Stock ordering is currently reactive (only when low).
*   **Solution**: Forecast-based replenishment.
*   **Scope**:
    *   **Demand Forecasting**: Predict future sales based on seasonal trends and historical peaks.
    *   **Auto-Replenishment**: Generate suggested Purchase Orders automatically based on predicted demand.
    *   **Profitability Analysis**: Advanced "Dead Stock" reports identifying items that aren't selling so you can clear them.
